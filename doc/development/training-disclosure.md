# Training Disclosure for rotocanvas
This Training Disclosure, which may be more specifically titled above here (and in this document possibly referred to as "this disclosure"), is based on **Training Disclosure version 1.1.4** at https://github.com/Hierosoft/training-disclosure by Jake Gustafson. Jake Gustafson is probably *not* an author of the project unless listed as a project author, nor necessarily the disclosure editor(s) of this copy of the disclosure unless this copy is the original which among other places I, Jake Gustafson, state IANAL. The original disclosure is released under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) license, but regarding any text that differs from the original:

This disclosure also functions as a claim of copyright to the scope described in the paragraph below since potentially in some jurisdictions output not of direct human origin, by certain means of generation at least, may not be copyrightable (again, IANAL):

Various author(s) may make claims of authorship to content in the project not mentioned in this disclosure, which this disclosure by way of omission unless stated elsewhere implies is of direct human origin unless stated elsewhere. Such statements elsewhere are present and complete if applicable to the best of the disclosure editor(s) ability. Additionally, the project author(s) hereby claim copyright and claim direct human origin to any and all content in the subsections of this disclosure itself, where scope is defined to the best of the ability of the disclosure editor(s), including the subsection names themselves, unless where stated, and unless implied such as by context, being copyrighted or trademarked elsewhere, or other means of statement or implication according to law in applicable jurisdiction(s).
