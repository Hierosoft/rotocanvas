### vob_to_dvd
Use linux to combine all of the VOBs from a DVD at /media/owner/MYMOVIE into one VOB, decrypted

make a bash script to do all that and save the resulting vob in ~/tmp

ok, I see a problem. Some unrelated apt update error that doesn't affect us could halt our script, so fix the vob script by splitting sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y vobcopy into separate lines.

this is getting out of hand. Convert it to Python and use libraries as necessary to avoid console commands if possible.

For backward compatibility add a python shebang, from __future__ import print_function, and use percent substitution not string interpolation.

ok now if there is no argument specified, just look through /media/%s where %s is the current username, and see which subfolder contains VIDEO_TS. If multiple contain it, show an error saying more than one dvd is inserted, list all of the resulting paths, and return 1 from main.

For compatibility, avoid pathlib, and just use os.makedirs if output_dir doesn't exist

Replace parts = line.split(',') with segments = line.split("Chapters:", 1) and parts = segments[0].split(',')

if sys.version_info.major >= 3, from subprocess import run as subprocess_run, else define a custom subprocess_run function that has the same args and returns but is python 2 compatible. Then use that in the program instead of subprocess.run

check isn't accepted by Popen in Python 2. Do check=kwargs.get("check") then if "check" in kwargs del kwargs["check"], then do whatever check would do manually instead of passing it to Popen

- This only affects fdist and a few lines of testing (3D etc)
write some tests for a distance formula called idist that accepts 2 points. Each point is a Python list.

turn this pseudocode into python: this_diag = (max(0, dot(quadrant_diagonal_vec2, (pos-center)) - .5) * 2.0)

how would I make float NumPy vec2 arrays pos and center, as well as quadrant_diagonal_vec2 normalized from (1, 1)?

implement vector normalization like: class linalg:
    @staticmethod
    def norm(vec):

Also create a __truediv__ method to implement vector division.

Also implement vector on vector division such as can be used like:
```
quadrant_diagonal_vec2 /= np.linalg.norm(quadrant_diagonal_vec2)  # Normalize
    nn_quadrant_diagonal_vec2 /= linalg.norm(nn_quadrant_diagonal_vec2)  # Normalize

    assertAllEqual(quadrant_diagonal_vec2, nn_quadrant_diagonal_vec2)
```
. Here is where to put your implementation:
```
class array(list):
    def __init__(self, values, dtype=float64):
        list.__init__(self)
        self += values
```

The following test:
- paste original version of test_array_and_norm (originally in module itself using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
fails with:
```Python

```
because you return a list from norm. Fix norm. Numpy's returns 1.4142135623730951 and yours returns [0.7071067811865475, 0.7071067811865475]

You still return array, stop doing that.

Fix norm so it returns a magnitude like numpy does, but only use Python's builtin modules such as math, not numpy itself:
- paste old version of class linalg partially made from code generated above other than class and __init__

Here is the documentation:
- Paste https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html contents

Now implement dot for it. Here is the documentation:

## output-reader.py
Draw this as ascii art:

- paste output from program (commented print line)

Actually use 0 and 1

Write a tkinter canvas program with File Open menu that opens json files and when one is opened, assume it is a dict. First fill the canvas with gray. Iterate the pairs. The key is a string, and should be split by "," to get coordinates, converted to an int pair. If the value is True, draw black at the coordinates, otherwise draw white. Here is an example input file: {

- paste new (partial JSON) output

Now assume that instead of true and false, there will be a float value from 0 to 1. Create a gray pixel of the value.

Instead of a bunch of rectangles, use a PIL image and set pixel. Add a Save As menu item that opens a file chooser, replaces .json with .png to save default output file path, then confirms to overwrite if file exists.

Here is partial updated save code:
```
    if not img:
        messagebox.showinfo(
            "Save File", "There is no image."
        )
        return
    initialfile = None
    if file_path:
        initialfile = os.path.splitext(file_path)[0] = ".png"
    file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(
        defaultextension=".png",
        filetypes=[("PNG files", "*.png")],
        initialfile=initialfile,
    )
```
. Now make the whole program object-oriented.


## md-icons-importer.py
I will use tk terms here but make me a pure guizero program, using only imaging libraries as nessary and avoid tk-specific code. Make an object-oriented tkinter app. In init, set self._last_search_time, set self._names = None, set self._results =[], set self._images = {}, set self._svg_dir = os.expanduser("~/Downloads/git/Templarian/MaterialDesign/svg"). Create a SearchResult class with a widgets = [] attribute. Using root.after, run a method that will list all files in self.svg_dir and set self.names to the result, or if not isdir, self.set_status("{} does not exist".format(repr(self.svg_dir))). For backward compatibility use format instead of f strings. The main has 3 parts, a ttk.Entry named search_entry with self.search_var tk.StringVar weight 0, and second part (row 1, stored as self.results_row) is a scrollable frame weight 1, the 3rd part is ttk.Entry state=readonly stringvar=self.status_var. Make a set_status(message) method that sets self.status_var to message. Whenever search_var changes, if len is >=2, run self.search with no args using root.after, otherwise run self.clear(). The search method should iterate self._names and if search_var.get() is in name, call self._add_result(name). The _add_result method should first try image = self._images.get(name). If None, load the file. If os.path.splitext(name).lower() == ".svg" convert it to an image allowing alpha transparency. Otherwise just load the image. Set self._images[name] to the resulting image. Create two widgets, an image widget with self._images[name] and a ttk label widget with text=name. For both use row=len(self._results). Place them in the scrollable panel, image at column 0 and label at column 1. Then add a new SearchResult named result and append both widgets to result.widgets. Append result to self._results. The clear method should iterate through self._results, and an inner loop iterate result.widgets and perform grid_forget on each.

Use a Python script to scale with edge directed interpolation, using CLI tools (or wrappers like wand) if necessary.

use argparse, and default width and height to 128. Move main code to a main method, calling it via sys.exit(main()) and returning 0 if good, or nonzero on error.

First convert the image to RGB32 using PIL. Save the temp image as f"{name_no_ext}.32bit.tmp.png". Default the output filename for this operation to f"{name_no_ext}_displacement.png". Add a boolean to the method for grayscale, defaulting to True. Convert the image to grayscale if True when saving the output.

Use the av module from pypi, a.k.a. PyAV, pythonic bindings for ffmpeg.

Make a separate function that creates a separate image name defaulting f"{name_no_ext}_diffuse.png". Change the output argument to a named argument "--output-displacement" and add a new argument "--output-diffuse". The function should use pyav if possible to mimic the result (otherwise use wand, Pythonic wrapper for PIL, only if necessary), but make a sigmoidal_contrast tuple argument that defaults to (5,50), and if None, exclude the argument from the process:
```
if [ "$add_noise" = "false" ]; then

  # For glass or image already >=64x64
convert \( $1 \
-colorspace Gray \
-filter Triangle \
-resize 128x128 \
-sigmoidal-contrast 5,50% \) \
-quality 100 \
$OUTPUT

else

convert \( $1 \
-colorspace Gray \
-filter Triangle \
-resize 128x128 \
-sigmoidal-contrast 5,50% \) \
\(  -size 128x128 xc:gray50 \
    -attenuate 0.45 \
    +noise Uniform  \
    -colorspace Gray    \
    -level 35%,65%      \
\) \
-compose overlay \
-composite \
-quality 100 \
$OUTPUT

fi
```

Rename make_diffuse_map to soft_scale and add a path_fmt parameter that defaults to "{}_diffuse.png". If the user doesn't include "{}" and only one "{}" in the parameter, raise a ValueError. Make add_noise default to True. Use the exact same noise for scale_with_edi but using only av. Make the scaling method a parameter and document all possible values available to av in the docstring and add it to the "--help" screen by adding the help and argument --diffuse-scale-method that defaults to what we have in that extra soft_scale function and a --bump-scale-method that defaults to edi.

Always output both maps. If a name argument is not defined, use the defaults.

Make a separate soft_scale_wand method. Move all of the old wand code from soft_scale to that. Only use the soft_scale_wand method if the "--diffuse-with-wand" argument is passed. Use it for bump (instead of make_bump_map) if "--diffuse-with-bump" is passed. Rename make_bump_map to enhanced_scale. Do not make a grayscale argument for the program. Always pass grayscale=True if generating a bump map, and always pass grayscale=False when generating a diffuse map.

At this point we can eliminate enhanced_scale and just set scale_method to the highest quality when generating a bump map ("nnedi", but if "--scale-bump-with-wand", use the method that is best quality available to wand, make a new scale_method for soft_scale_wand, and add all of the possible values to the docstring).

Split soft_scale into two methods, one called "soft_scale_file" that operates on files and calls soft_scale which operates on Image objects. Use the same technique to split soft_scale_wand and move file handling code and arguments to a soft_scale_wand_file function that calls it.

I said to always generate both images, bump and diffuse, so set the fallback names and options in main as appropriate. As stated, use grayscale and high quality scaling for generating the bump file, and low quality scaling and grayscale=False for generating the diffuse file.  --bump-with-wand and --diffuse-with-wand should cause use of wand for each, respectively. Import wand like:
```
has_wand = False
try:
    from wand.image import Image as WandImage
    has_wand = True
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    print("No wand support ({} cannot find the module)"
          .format(repr(sys.executable)), file=sys.stderr)
```
If wand is specified by the user for either map, and has_wand is False, say wand is not available and return nonzero.

Make a third pair of methods, soft_scale_av, and soft_scale_av_file and use soft_scale_av_file and allow the user to choose that using --diffuse-with-av or --bump-with-av and use the edge-directed scaling. Import av with a try block and set a has_av option. If user specifies either and has_av is False, say av is not available and return nonzero.

Make error print statements have uniform output using:
```
def formatted_ex(ex):
    return "{}:, {}".format(type(ex).__name__, ex)
```

- ". . . Do you also want me to expose scale method choice for AV (e.g. nnedi, bicubic, etc.) via CLI like we did earlier, or should it be locked to nnedi for bump and bicubic for diffuse?"

yes

- ". . . Would you like me to fully implement the AV backend (with av.filter.Graph + nnedi/scale) now, instead of using Pillow internally as a placeholder? That’ll give you true ffmpeg edge-directed interpolation."

Yes

You must manually set defaults apart from argparse for this to work. If not set, the default for bump_scale_method should be liquid rescale in the case of using wand. There should be no wand_scale_method argument. Show a help screen with "--help" even if no argument is specified. Make the general help (not argument help) longer so the user can see a list of each scaling methods, making the main program help string have the following at the end of it:  "\n\nPillow (default):\nAvailable scale methods{}\n\nav:\nAvailable scale methods{}\n\nwand:\nAvailable scale methods{}\n\nav:".format(soft_scale.__doc__.split("Available scale methods")[1], soft_scale_av.__doc__.split("Available scale methods")[1], soft_scale_wand.__doc__.split("Available scale methods")[1]). Be sure to use line continuations to keep lines down to 79 characters, 72 for comments, as per PEP8.

- "Would you like me to also wire in the actual file-based calls (soft_scale_file, soft_scale_av_file, soft_scale_wand_file) so the bump and diffuse images are written out automatically to the fallback paths?"

Yes

- "Do you want me to also actually implement the av scaling with nnedi and scale filters (instead of the current placeholder), or keep it as a stub for now?"

Implement the scaling fully in every backend using every step and every default I originally specified.

Use av's own filters in av mode.

- "Would you like me to match the ImageMagick noise recipe more closely (attenuate 0.45, level 35–65) by chaining eq=contrast=1:brightness=0.0: gamma=... after noise, or is the ffmpeg noise+blend overlay approximation good enough for your use case?"

Match the noise as closely as possible.

- "Do you also want me to replace the Pillow and Wand implementations with stricter step-by-step equivalents (with sigmoidal contrast + noise overlay) so that all three backends follow the exact same pipeline?"

Yes

- ". . . Would you like me to now write the full integrated code (with soft_scale_file, soft_scale_av_file, soft_scale_wand_file, noise sync, AV filters, and argparse help screen) in one pass, so you can run and test it directly?"

Yes

- ". . . Do you want me to also synchronize the random noise so the exact same pattern is applied to both bump and diffuse, even across different backends? This would be important if the maps are used together for displacement."

No, use noise native to each backend to allow fully leveraging each backend. Also, stop disregarding and deleting previous requirements such as
```

    # MANUAL DEFAULTS (explicit, separate from argparse)
    # bump backend defaults:
    #   - Wand -> liquid_rescale
    #   - AV   -> nnedi
    #   - Pillow -> lanczos (high-quality PIL)
    if args.bump_with_wand:
        default_bump_method = "liquid_rescale"
    elif args.bump_with_av:
        default_bump_method = "nnedi"
    else:
        default_bump_method = "lanczos"

    # diffuse defaults:
    #   - Wand -> triangle (softer)
    #   - AV   -> nnedi (if user specifically chooses AV)
    #   - Pillow -> bicubic
    if args.diffuse_with_wand:
        default_diffuse_method = "triangle"
    elif args.diffuse_with_av:
        default_diffuse_method = "nnedi"
    else:
        default_diffuse_method = "bicubic"
```

- ". . . If you want, I can now merge this adjusted main() with the full previous script so you have a ready-to-run, fully compliant version including all backends and noise logic. . . ."

Yes, and don't forget the docstrings including an "Available scale methods" section in each.

- ". . . Do you want me to also implement the temp RGB32 conversion step like your first requirements, so that all backends operate on a consistent 32-bit input? This can help maintain uniform scaling behavior."

Yes
